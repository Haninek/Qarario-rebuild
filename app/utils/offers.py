    Generate a list of recommended loan offers based on the applicant's
    normalised score and financial capacity (deposits). Higher scores get
    LOWER factor rates. Offers are capped based on monthly deposits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score: float
        The applicant's total normalised score (0â€“100).
    input_data: dict

    list[dict]
        A list of loan offer dictionaries with amount, rate, term, and daily payment.
